# django_blog
* This Django blog project is a simple and dynamic web application that allows users to create, view, and manage blog posts.
* It is built using Django, a high-level Python web framework that provides built-in support for database management, authentication, and templating.
* The blog provides essential features such as post images, timestamps, and author names (if needed).
# Key Features:
✅ Blog Post Management – Users can create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) blog posts.

✅ Post Image Uploads – Each blog post can include an image to enhance content.

✅ Author Information (Optional) – Displays an author’s name if provided.

✅ Timestamps – Shows when a post was created for better organization.

✅ Django Admin Panel – Users can manage blog posts easily.

✅ Database Integration – Uses Django ORM to store and retrieve blog data efficiently.
# How It Works:
* Users (No Authentication) – Any visitor can view the blog, and post creation can be unrestricted or managed via the Django admin panel.
* Blog Posts – Each post includes:
  * Title: The main heading of the post.
  * Image: An optional image uploaded along with the post.
  * Content: The main body of the post.
  * Author (Optional): A manually entered name field if required.
  * Date: The timestamp when the post was created.
* Database Handling – The Django ORM manages storing and retrieving blog data.
* Admin Panel – Superusers can create, edit, and delete blog posts from the Django admin interface.
* Templates – HTML templates dynamically display blog posts with images and timestamps.
